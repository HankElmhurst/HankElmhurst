👋 Hi, I’m @HankElmhurst

Mid-career data professional and current M.S. in Data Science student at the University of Virginia (expected Aug 2026).  
I previously spent more than a decade at the U.S. Census Bureau working on large-scale federal economic data systems.

- **Applied data science & analytics**
  - Cleaning and structuring messy real-world data
  - Building interpretable models for policy, compliance, and business decisions
- **Decision / risk systems**
  - Public-sector and civic analytics (economic statistics, public health, investigations)
  - Operations, forecasting, and resource-allocation problems
- **Current graduate work**
  - Bayesian inference and decision theory
  - Statistical inference/ Machine Learning  
  - Data structures, relational databases, and ETL  
  - Introductory text / document analysis (NLP foundations)

## Tools & languages

- **Programming:** Python, R, Scripting, Java  
- **Data & modeling:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, tidyverse, tidymodels, ggplot2
